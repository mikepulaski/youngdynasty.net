[RadBlock](https://radblock.app) is a Safari extension for macOS which helps you surf with less ads, trackers, and annoyances.

Rather than striving for blocking perfection, its main focus is to preserve your battery life by using less resources, and to blend in with the Macâ€™s native ecosystem. And it does a killer job -- it's up to **200x more efficient** than existing blockers. You can read all about it on the [RadBlock Blog](https://radblock.app/blog/introducing-radblock/).

It's currently in a private beta, but it's super easy to get an invite. All you have to do is follow [@RadBlockApp](https://twitter.com/radblockapp) on Twitter, and you'll get a DM with a download link.[^1]

[^1]: Beta invites are processed based on time and capacity, so hang tight!
