A few days ago, Young Dynasty officially became a registered company in France. Although there's still quite a bit of paperwork to do in order to launch [Emporter](https://emporter.app), there are plenty of things I've learned along the way that I'd like to share with the community.

This year, I intend to post about interesting engineering solutions, product development, and anything else related to launching, managing and using Emporter.

As a one-person company with one product to launch, it's going to be an exciting year.

Happy 2019! üçæ
