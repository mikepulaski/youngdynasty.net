Young Dynasty is a one-person company ran by me, [Mikey](/images/mikey.jpg).

I'm a full-stack software developer currently located in Paris, France. I've been writing code for over a decade on multiple platforms.

Aside from freelancing, I manage, develop, and design [Emporter](https://emporter.app). Before that, I worked on [Espresso](https://www.espressoapp.com).

In my free time, I climb rocks, do yoga, eat burritos and go on adventures with my [wife](http://www.roseromain.com) and [dog](/images/boosie.jpeg).

Want to say hello? [Email me](mailto:mikey@youngdynasty.net).
