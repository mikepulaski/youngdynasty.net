		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;) is a regulation in European law which essentially defines how a user&rsquo;s personal information must be handled. If a company serves Europeans and it does not follow these regulations, it is at risk for receiving hefty fines.</p>

<p>GDPR itself seems to catch a lot of negative attention within the developer community. I must say, my initial reactions were mostly negative as well. <em>Won&rsquo;t these regulations just add more friction when launching small projects? How do I know that I&rsquo;m compliant? Is my project worth the risk?</em></p>

<p>Bear in mind, I reside in Paris, and Young Dynasty is a French company. I had to make sure that <a href="https://emporter.app">Emporter</a> was GDPR compliant at launch. I did not have the luxury of rolling out other territories while deferring the launch in Europe to address potential compliance issues.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, though, if I tried to explain my frustration with anyone outside of tech, I was often met with a blank stare. <em>Why wouldn&rsquo;t a company protect their user&rsquo;s data? If a company is storing my data, it&rsquo;s not theirs to keep. Aren&rsquo;t all professionals subject to regulations? What makes tech so special?</em></p>

<p>These rheotorical questions made me realize something so obvious: <strong>GDPR compliance will help me establish trust with users</strong>. This is particularly important for a small company, such as mine, wishing to attract new customers.</p>

<p>Let me frame this train of thought using <a href="https://emporter.app">Emporter</a> as an example.</p>

<p>Emporter creates a public, secure URL which can be used to access a folder or server on your Mac. There&rsquo;s a certain level of trust that needs to be established in order for people to use it, in terms of privacy and security.</p>

<p>GDPR compliance itself does not mean that an app respects your privacy, but it allows the opportunity to provide confidence that its author cares. And, because I actually <em>do</em> care, Emporter does <em>not</em> collect or store user data. To address security concerns, I distribute it within the Mac App Store because its applications are reviewed, signed, and only run within a sandboxed environment.</p>

<p>In the end, I worked closely with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/camillegaffiot">Camille Caffiot</a> on the <a href="https://emporter.app/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> to make sure I was compliant. It did cost more money than using a premade policy or template, but establishing trust and protecting myself in terms of liability is so important that it was absolutely worth every <em>centime</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a little harder to launch projects now, but our industry is maturing. As a developer, I think my negativity was largely due to the fact that I became spoiled.</p>
